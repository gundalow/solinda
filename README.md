## Game Modes

### 🃏 Solitaire Classics
Enjoy the quintessential card games with a clean, intuitive interface optimized for mobile play.
*   **Klondike Solitaire:** The standard game of patience. Build your foundations from Ace to King. Supports both **Deal 1** and **Deal 3** modes.
*   **FreeCell Solitaire:** A highly strategic variant where nearly every deal is a puzzle waiting to be solved. Use your four free cells wisely to clear the board.

### 💎 Jewelinda
Dive into a vibrant Match-3 adventure featuring deep mechanics and explosive gameplay.
*   **Innovative Objectives:**
    *   **Color Collection:** Match and collect specific gems to reach your target.
    *   **Frost Clearance:** Break through layers of "Cracked Ice" by matching gems on frosted tiles.
    *   **Hybrid Levels:** Experience levels that combine multiple objectives for ultimate challenge.
*   **Powerful Special Gems:**
    *   **Bombs:** Form a 4-gem match to create a Bomb. Detonate it to clear a 3x3 area!
    *   **Hypergems:** Create a match of 5 or more (or T/L shapes) to spawn a Hypergem. Swapping a Hypergem with any color triggers a mass explosion of all gems of that color on the board.
*   **Dynamic Visuals:** Satisfying physics-based animations, "squash-and-stretch" effects upon impact, and a custom-built particle engine for spectacular match sequences.
*   **Tactile Feedback:** Feel every match and explosion with carefully tuned haptic feedback.
